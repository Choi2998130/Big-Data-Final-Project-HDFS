This repository contains all scripts and outputs developed for the IST3134 Big Data Analytics coursework, focusing on AWS Hadoop MapReduce implementations using Python Streaming.
Each Use Case (UC1–UC3) follows a structured approach:

Mapper Script (mapper_ucX.py) – Extracts and transforms relevant fields from the dataset into key–value pairs for parallel processing.

Reducer Script (reducer_ucX.py) – Aggregates, summarizes, or computes statistics from the intermediate key–value pairs generated by the Mapper.

AWS Visualization Script (aws_visual_ucX.py) – Generates charts or tables from the EMR output stored in S3, allowing quick insight into results.

Local Python Node Script (validate_ucX.py) – Runs the same logic on a small dataset locally (single-node execution) to verify MapReduce results before EMR deployment.
